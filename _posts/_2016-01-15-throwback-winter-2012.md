Winter is here and came a bit later than usual. Snow is something we are very fond of as you can tell we are from the Philippines and snow is something we see only on screen or print but never an experience.

During lunch breaks the attendees were encouraged to roam around the block close to the venue. My plan was simple: Spot the local attendees and follow their lunch trail. It always works! So, plus points there for decoding Spanish!

It took us some ten minutes of navigating the tiny streets of Barcelona until the leader of the pack declared that we arrived to the spot. [Hamburguesería Bacoa](http://www.bacoa.es/en/) makes superb burgers. My lunch was the **Asturiana,** which according to the menu: organic beef char-grilled to medium, tomato, lettuce, goat and Danish blue cheese and caramelized onions. Paired with local *Mortiz* beer. It was delicious.
